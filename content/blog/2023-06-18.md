I don't write very often.
I've done little bits and pieces here and there, but never anything more substatial then a few hundred words.
I don't know why I don't write more often, to be honest -- 
I'm told that I have a good style, but that doesn't seem to be enough encoragement for my brain.


Hopefully, having thoughts up here will help me to write more. Don't always expect quality content.
